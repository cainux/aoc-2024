# Advent of Code 2024

Trying out `lua` this year

Packages used:

- `rex_pcre2`
  - for regular expressions
  - need to `yay pcre2` to install the tool on the OS
  - then `sudo luarocks install lrexlib-PCRE2`

Ideally we don't have to install `luarocks` packages globally but
I haven't figured out how to resolve them locally when running `lua`.
